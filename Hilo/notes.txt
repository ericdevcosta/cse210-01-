Designing the Hilo Game

1. Find objects in the program:
- Starting points (300)
- Cards(1-13)
- Player

2. Define the responsibilities for each object:
- Starting points will increase or decrease depending on player's actions.
- Cards will randomly be displayed.
- Player will choose if the next card to be displayed is higher or lower.

3. Define the relationship between the objects.
- The player chooses if the next card is higher or lower.
- If he guesses it correcly, he earns 100 points.
- If he guesses it incorrecly, he loses 75 points.
- If the player loses all points, the game is over.
- If the player still has points, he will be asked if he wants to continue or not.
- The game ends if the player decides to quit.

4. Translate the objects into classes:
- Class Cards
- current_card
-
